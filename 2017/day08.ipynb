       "<h2>--- Day 8: I Heard You Like Registers ---</h2><p>You receive a <span title=\"There's that sorcery I told you about.\">signal</span> directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with <a href=\"5\">jump instructions</a>, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual register instructions.</p><p>Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at <code>0</code>. The instructions look like this:</p><pre><code>b inc 5 if a &gt; 1\n",
       "a inc 1 if b &lt; 5\n",
       "c dec -10 if a &gt;= 1\n",
       "c inc -20 if c == 10\n",
       "</code></pre><p>These instructions would be processed as follows:</p><ul>\n",
       "<li>Because <code>a</code> starts at <code>0</code>, it is not greater than <code>1</code>, and so <code>b</code> is not modified.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>a</code> is increased by <code>1</code> (to <code>1</code>) because <code>b</code> is less than <code>5</code> (it is <code>0</code>).</li><li>\n",
       "<code>c</code> is decreased by <code>-10</code> (to <code>10</code>) because <code>a</code> is now greater than or equal to <code>1</code> (it is <code>1</code>).</li><li>\n",
       "<code>c</code> is increased by <code>-20</code> (to <code>-10</code>) because <code>c</code> is equal to <code>10</code>.</li>\n",
       "</ul><p>After this process, the largest value in any register is <code>1</code>.</p><p>You might also encounter <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal to) or <code>!=</code> (not equal to). However, the CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves that to you to determine.</p><p>\n",
