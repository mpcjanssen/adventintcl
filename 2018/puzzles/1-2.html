<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches <em>twice</em>.</p><p>For example, using the same list of changes above, the device would loop as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Current frequency <code> 0</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code> 1</code>.</li><li>Current frequency <code> 1</code>, change of <code>-2</code>; resulting frequency <code>-1</code>.</li><li>Current frequency <code>-1</code>, change of <code>+3</code>; resulting frequency <code> 2</code>.</li><li>Current frequency <code> 2</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code> 3</code>.</li><li>(At this point, the device continues from the start of the list.)</li><li>Current frequency <code> 3</code>, change of <code>+1</code>; resulting frequency <code> 4</code>.</li><li>Current frequency <code> 4</code>, change of <code>-2</code>; resulting frequency <code> 2</code>, which has already been seen.</li>
</ul><p>In this example, the first frequency reached twice is <code>2</code>. Note that your device might need to repeat its list of frequency changes many times before a duplicate frequency is found, and that duplicates might be found while in the middle of processing the list.</p><p>Here are other examples:</p><ul>
<li>
<code>+1, -1</code> first reaches <code>0</code> twice.</li><li>
<code>+3, +3, +4, -2, -4</code> first reaches <code>10</code> twice.</li><li>
<code>-6, +3, +8, +5, -6</code> first reaches <code>5</code> twice.</li><li>
<code>+7, +7, -2, -7, -4</code> first reaches <code>14</code> twice.</li>
</ul><p><em>What is the first frequency your device reaches twice?</em></p>
