Moves are always exactly one house to the north (<code>^</code>), south (<code>v</code>), east (<code>&gt;</code>), or west (<code>&lt;</code>).  After each move, he delivers another present to the house at his new location.</p><p>However, the elf back at the north pole has had a little too much eggnog, and so his directions are a little off, and Santa ends up visiting some houses more than once.  How many houses receive <em>at least one present</em>?</p><p>For example:</p><ul>\n",
