       "<h2>--- Day 16: Aunt Sue ---</h2><p>Your Aunt Sue has given you a wonderful gift, and you'd like to send her a thank you card.  However, there's a small problem: she signed it \"From, Aunt Sue\".</p><p>You have 500 Aunts named \"Sue\".</p><p>So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift.  You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine!  Just what you wanted.  Or needed, as the case may be.</p><p>The My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine (MFCSAM for short) can detect a few specific compounds in a given sample, as well as how many distinct kinds of those compounds there are. According to the instructions, these are what the MFCSAM can detect:</p><ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<code>children</code>, by human DNA age analysis.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>cats</code>.  It doesn't differentiate individual breeds.</li><li>Several <span title=\"It can tell them apart by their distinct Dog Residue.\">seemingly random breeds of dog</span>: <code><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyed_%28dog%29\">samoyeds</a></code>, <code><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_%28dog%29\">pomeranians</a></code>, <code><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akita_%28dog%29\">akitas</a></code>, and <code><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizsla\">vizslas</a></code>.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>goldfish</code>.  No other kinds of fish.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>trees</code>, all in one group.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>cars</code>, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>perfumes</code>, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.</li>\n",
       "</ul><p>In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these.  You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM.  It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticker_tape\">ticker tape</a>:</p><pre><code>children: 3\n",
