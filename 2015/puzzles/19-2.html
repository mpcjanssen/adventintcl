<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Now that the machine is calibrated, you're ready to begin molecule fabrication.</p><p>Molecule fabrication always begins with just a single <span title="It's a Red-Nosed Reindeer electron.">electron</span>, <code>e</code>, and applying replacements one at a time, just like the ones during calibration.</p><p>For example, suppose you have the following replacements:</p><pre><code>e =&gt; H
e =&gt; O
H =&gt; HO
H =&gt; OH
O =&gt; HH
</code></pre><p>If you'd like to make <code>HOH</code>, you start with <code>e</code>, and then make the following replacements:</p><ul>
<li>
<code>e =&gt; O</code> to get <code>O</code>
</li><li>
<code>O =&gt; HH</code> to get <code>HH</code>
</li><li>
<code>H =&gt; OH</code> (on the second <code>H</code>) to get <code>HOH</code>
</li>
</ul><p>So, you could make <code>HOH</code> after <em>
<code>3</code> steps</em>.  Santa's favorite molecule, <code>HOHOHO</code>, can be made in <em>
<code>6</code> steps</em>.</p><p>How long will it take to make the medicine?  Given the available <em>replacements</em> and the <em>medicine molecule</em> in your puzzle input, what is the <em>fewest number of steps</em> to go from <code>e</code> to the medicine molecule?</p>
