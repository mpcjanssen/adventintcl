<h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You flip the instructions over; Santa goes on to point out that this is all just an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a>.  At least, it was, until you notice that something's wrong with the grid of lights you bought: four lights, one in each corner, are <em>stuck on</em> and can't be turned off.  The example above will actually run like this:</p><pre><code>Initial state:
##.#.#
...##.
#....#
..#...
#.#..#
####.#

After 1 step:
#.##.#
####.#
...##.
......
#...#.
#.####

After 2 steps:
#..#.#
#....#
.#.##.
...##.
.#..##
##.###

After 3 steps:
#...##
####.#
..##.#
......
##....
####.#

After 4 steps:
#.####
#....#
...#..
.##...
#.....
#.#..#

After 5 steps:
##.###
.##..#
.##...
.##...
#.#...
##...#
</code></pre><p>After <code>5</code> steps, this example now has <code>17</code> lights on.</p><p>In your grid of 100x100 lights, given your initial configuration, but with the four corners always in the <em>on</em> state, <em>how many lights are on after 100 steps</em>?</p>
