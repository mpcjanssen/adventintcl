       "<h2>--- Day 8: Handheld Halting ---</h2><p>Your flight to the major airline hub reaches cruising altitude without incident.  While you consider checking the in-flight menu for one of those drinks that come with a little umbrella, you are interrupted by the kid sitting next to you.</p><p>Their <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handheld_game_console\">handheld game console</a> won't turn on! They ask if you can take a look.</p><p>You narrow the problem down to a strange <em>infinite loop</em> in the <span title=\"A trendy new line of encrypted footwear?\">boot code</span> (your puzzle input) of the device. You should be able to fix it, but first you need to be able to run the code in isolation.</p><p>The boot code is represented as a text file with one <em>instruction</em> per line of text. Each instruction consists of an <em>operation</em> (<code>acc</code>, <code>jmp</code>, or <code>nop</code>) and an <em>argument</em> (a signed number like <code>+4</code> or <code>-20</code>).</p><ul>\n",
       "<li>\n",
       "<code>acc</code> increases or decreases a single global value called the <em>accumulator</em> by the value given in the argument. For example, <code>acc +7</code> would increase the accumulator by 7. The accumulator starts at <code>0</code>. After an <code>acc</code> instruction, the instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>jmp</code><em>jumps</em> to a new instruction relative to itself. The next instruction to execute is found using the argument as an <em>offset</em> from the <code>jmp</code> instruction; for example, <code>jmp +2</code> would skip the next instruction, <code>jmp +1</code> would continue to the instruction immediately below it, and <code>jmp -20</code> would cause the instruction 20 lines above to be executed next.</li><li>\n",
       "<code>nop</code> stands for <em>No OPeration</em> - it does nothing.  The instruction immediately below it is executed next.</li>\n",
       "</ul><p>For example, consider the following program:</p><pre><code>nop +0\n",
       "acc +1\n",
       "jmp +4\n",
       "acc +3\n",
       "jmp -3\n",

       "acc +1\n",
       "jmp -4\n",
       "acc +6\n",
       "</code></pre><p>These instructions are visited in this order:</p><pre><code>nop +0  | 1\n",
       "acc +1  | 2, 8(!)\n",
       "jmp +4  | 3\n",
       "acc +3  | 6\n",
       "jmp -3  | 7\n",
       "acc -99 |\n",
       "acc +1  | 4\n",
       "jmp -4  | 5\n",
       "acc +6  |\n",
       "</code></pre><p>First, the <code>nop +0</code> does nothing. Then, the accumulator is increased from 0 to 1 (<code>acc +1</code>) and <code>jmp +4</code> sets the next instruction to the other <code>acc +1</code> near the bottom. After it increases the accumulator from 1 to 2, <code>jmp -4</code> executes, setting the next instruction to the only <code>acc +3</code>. It sets the accumulator to 5, and <code>jmp -3</code> causes the program to continue back at the first <code>acc +1</code>.</p><p>This is an <em>infinite loop</em>: with this sequence of jumps, the program will run forever. The moment the program tries to run any instruction a second time, you know it will never terminate.</p><p>Immediately <em>before</em> the program would run an instruction a second time, the value in the accumulator is <em><code>5</code></em>.</p><p>Run your copy of the boot code. Immediately before any instruction is executed a second time, <em>what value is in the accumulator?</em>\n",
